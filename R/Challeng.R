#' Challenger dataset of O-rings failure
#'
#' The dataset includes information on O-rings damage from the previous 23 Challenger flights
#' There are 6 O-rings involved in each flight.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 392 rows and 9 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{date}{Date of launch}
#'   \item{temp}{Outside temperature at launch (degrees F)}
#'   \item{pres}{Leak check pressure}
#'   \item{fail}{Number of O-rings that exhibited damage, essentially by erosion or blowby}
#'   \item{n}{Number of O-rings in each Challenger launch}
#'   \item{erosion}{Number of O-rings with erosion, arguably the most important outcome variable}
#'   \item{blowby}{Number of blowby incidents}
#'   \item{damage}{Total Damage Index, a composite of uncertain derivation, likely erosion, blowby, depth, location, extent and view according to Tufte}
